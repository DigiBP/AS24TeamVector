## Introduction

The usage of narcotics in a veterinary clinic requires the implementation of strict rules to prevent potential misuse. Despite clear legal regulation, the implementation of the processes regarding narcotics management can vary greatly between different clinics. The clinic in question handles all related processes manually and there is no automation in existence. Paperwork is not digitalized, there is no clear defined way of communication between different parties and the responsibility for reordering narcotics out of stock is not specified. 

Twice daily there are countings and comparisons of the usage of narcotics against the remaining stock, to prevent misuse. 

## Goal

We aim to reduce the amount of paperwork by digitalizing the inventory lists and providing an automated reorderprocess. 

## AS-IS Process

All is initiated with a new patient's arrival and the evaluation of the veterinarian for the need of narcotics for this individual patient. If it is decided that narcotics are needed (this can include anaesthesia, analgesia and seizure management) the sub process of applying the narcotics to this specific patient is started. A paper form is filled out to document required information and after filling it out the narcotics are taken out and applied to the patient. If a new vial is opened but not used up completely it is either thrown out and documented or stored for later use for the specific patient it got taken out for. 
Twice a day the list of narcotics used is checked against the stock to ensure everything is tracked accordingly. There are two safes to store narcotics in the clinic. A small safe, which is accessible for the veterinarians on duty to provide patients with narcotics. And a big safe, which is only accessible to the team managing narcotics to stock up the small safe if needed but to further prevent abuse of narcotics. 
If necessary the small safe is stocked up with narcotics from the big safe and the big safe is evaluated once daily and new narcotics, if needed, are ordered via the supply chain team. 

### Inventory and supply chain (for Sarah) 

Once daily one person from the narcotics team checks the big safes inventory and evaluates with a threshold if an order of new narcotics needs to be placed. The threshold is defined with a great margin to make sure no shortage or delivery difficulties obstruct the availability of the important medications. In case no order needs to be placed the small safe undergoes inventory checking to make sure the veterinarians can access important medications directly and easily. If a narcotic medicament in the small safe falls under a certain threshold it will be restocked from the big safe accordingly. 

When one or more medicament in the big safe falls below the threshold to ensure constant availability in the clinic, an order will be placed. To place the order the member of the narcotics team, who checked stocks in the big safe, informs the purchaising team about the order. The purchaising team then places the order. Upon arrival they will check the order and accept it when no discrepancies are present. 
The narcotics team is informed about the arrival and fill the ordered medicaments into the big safe. Lastly the have to update the inventory list of the big safe again to match the new stock. 


## TO BE Process 

For clarification and since it is not relevant for our process optimization the veterinarian is considered as a customer of the inhouse pharmacy and the process is visualized as a black box.

## Digitalization Inventory List 

## Chatbot/LLM vs Decision Table 
- we can document the work on the decision table and argue that we dropped it if the LLM works and we want to implement that instead
