## Introduction 💊⚠️📄💉❌

Narcotic medications, defined as substances that have a high potential for abuse and are regulated under strict control, fall into a special category of medications in Switzerland, requiring careful management and oversight. 
Narcotic medications are widely used in veterinary medicine. For instance, methadone or buprenorphine may be used to manage severe pain for indications including surgeries, injuries or conditions causing chronic issues. In addition, sedation with, for example, propofol can be used for veterinary patients undergoing certain treatments or surgery, or improved handling or diagnostic procedures. For animals with seizures midazolam may be required. For situations involving euthanasia, certain narcotics, like barbiturates (pentobarbital), are used for compassionate euthanasia in terminally ill or critically injured animals.
The usage of narcotics in a veterinary clinic requires the implementation of rigorous and efficient processes to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent misuse. Experience has shown that the implementation of the processes regarding narcotics management can vary greatly between different clinics. 
Despite legal frameworks, narcotics management is often handled manually with no automation, resulting in inefficiencies and potential risks. For most veterinary clinics, the majority of the process is paper based and is not digitalized. Additionally, there is no clearly defined way of communication between different parties and the responsibility for reordering narcotics out of stock is not specified. In addition, due to disruptions in global supply chains, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or shipping delays, the availability of critical narcotic medications in veterinary care has been increasingly unpredictable. The lead-up to ordering alternatives is frequently slow, inefficient and occasionally problematic, potentially leading to critical incidents in veterinary care. 
The combination of these issues are truly detrimental to the valuable veterinary healthcare resources and time of, already overworked and understaffed, veterinary staff. A rough estimate has shown that approximately 600h may be spent in an average sized veterinary clinic for managing narcotics with these inefficient processes, with realistic potential spending in the range of 20,000 to 40,000 CHF.  
Our vision is to enhance tracking and streamline workflow management, thereby contributing to the efficiency and safety of narcotic management. Implementing an automated system that suggests alternative medications to supply chain managers, ensuring that any shortages are quickly addressed with minimal disruption allows providing the best possible care for the animal patients. 

### Current Challenges:
This problem was addressed in the context of one veterinary clinic, to provide realistic, actionable and viable processes (with possible scaling/generalization to other clinics and/or applications). 
While this will be described in more detail below, several issues in the current narcotics management are presently highlighted. The clinic in question handles all narcotics-related processes manually, with no automation and exclusively paper based. Stock tracking also occurs manually and is paper-based. Twice daily, specialized staff counts the number of remaining narcotics, and does a cross validation on the documented usage of narcotics against the remaining stock. There is no automation in reordering and stock updates. In addition, the responsibilities are not truly clear, with limited communication between different stakeholders in this process.
